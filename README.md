# 🧘‍♂️ Gamify Wellness: Yogasana Web App 🌿🎮

*A Hackathon Project That Tries to Make Yoga Fun! (Emphasis on *tries*)*

---

## 🚀 About the Project

**Gamify Wellness** is a web app designed to bring a fun, interactive approach to **Yogasanas (yoga poses)** by incorporating gamification.

Yoga is great for health, but let’s be honest—it’s hard to stay motivated. Our goal was to make it **engaging, rewarding, and maybe even competitive!**

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This was built in a **hackathon under extreme time pressure**. We know it’s not perfect (it’s _far_ from it), but hey—we shipped something!

---

## 🎯 Features (a.k.a. Things That _Mostly_ Work)

- ✅ **Yogasana Tracking** – Select different yoga poses & track progress
- ✅ **Basic Gamification** – Earn points (sometimes?) when completing sessions
- ✅ **User Authentication** – Signup/Login (because every app needs auth, right?)
- ✅ **Leaderboard** – See who’s doing the best… if the database decides to cooperate
- ✅ **Simple UI** – By "simple," we mean _very_ simple

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (with questionable CSS choices)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (which may or may not work as expected)
- **Authentication:** JWT (hopefully secure)

## 🚀 Deployment Attempt (And Failure 😅)  
We **tried** to deploy this project, but unfortunately, we **weren’t able to get it running properly**. Deployment issues, configuration headaches, and time constraints got the best of us. Maybe in the future, we’ll get it live! 🚀  

---

## 📌 Lessons Learned (a.k.a. What We’d Do Differently)  
- 🔹 **Better UI/UX planning** – Because let’s be real, this UI is tragic  
- 🔹 **More testing** – Half of our features worked *sometimes*  
- 🔹 **Time management** – Maybe spend less time debugging, more time structuring  
- 🔹 **Smoother database integration** – MongoDB really tested our patience  
- 🔹 **Better deployment strategy** – So we don’t struggle next time 😭

## 💡 Final Thoughts  
This project might not be the most polished thing in the world, but **we built something**. We showed up, coded for hours, debugged like crazy, and at the end of the day—we made it through. 💪  

- ✅ **Did we launch a groundbreaking product?** No.  
- ✅ **Did we have fun (and frustration) building it?** Absolutely.  
- ✅ **Would we do another hackathon?** …Maybe after some therapy.
